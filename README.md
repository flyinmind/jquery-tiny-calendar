====================

jquery tiny calendar

A js calendar base on jquery 1.7+.
It is very simple, only 350+ lines javascript code.
Support mode 'single','range' and 'multi',
and can show more than one calendar at the same time.
It is useful when a range selection calendar, you can show 2 calendars.

Apache license 2.0, You can use it freely.

You can read example.htm to get all usages.

$.fn.calendar({
        target: 'the input bind to the calendar, start with #',
        mode: 'single', /*range|single|multi*/
        format: 'display date on the calendar title',
        ok:'the function when selected',
        num:'the number of displayed calendar',
});

It is so simple so I don't write more words about how to use it.
